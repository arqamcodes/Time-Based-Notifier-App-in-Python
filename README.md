# Time-Based-Notifier-App-in-Python

I've created a time-based notifier app that utilizes the time module and "time.strftime" to determine the current time on your PC. The application dynamically outputs a personalized greeting based on the time of day: "Good morning" if the time is before 12 PM, "Good evening" if it's between 12 PM and 5 PM, and "Good night" if it's 5 PM or later.
